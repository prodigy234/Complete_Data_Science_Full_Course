    "In programming, a loop is a fundamental concept that allows us to execute a block of code repeatedly instead of writing it multiple times. Loops are extremely powerful because they enable automation, repetition, and efficiency when handling tasks involving collections (like lists, dictionaries) or when a task needs to be repeated under certain conditions."
